# Spring AI - Structured Output

This repository demonstrates how to use **Spring AI's Structured Output Converters** to transform responses from Large Language Models (LLMs) into clean, usable data formats for your Java applications.

ðŸš€ **It covers several key ways to get structured data**:
*   Generating raw **JSON responses** directly from the AI model.
*   Converting AI output into specific **Java objects (Entities)** using `BeanOutputConverter`.
*   Obtaining a **List of Java objects (Entities)** for multiple structured items.
*   Getting flexible **Map-based output** (`Map<String, Object>`) for dynamic data structures.
*   Retrieving simple **Lists of Strings** using `ListOutputConverter`.

All examples are built around a fun "Social Media Analytics" theme.
